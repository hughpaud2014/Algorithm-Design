# Closest Pair Algorithm

The closest pair algorithm is a computational algorithm used to find the pair of points in a given set of points that are closest to each other. It is commonly used in various applications such as computational geometry, computer graphics, and pattern recognition.

## Algorithm Steps

1. Sort the points based on their x-coordinates in ascending order.
2. Divide the sorted points into two equal halves.
3. Recursively find the closest pair in each half.
4. Determine the minimum distance between the closest pairs in each half.
5. Find the strip of points within the minimum distance from the middle line.
6. Sort the strip points based on their y-coordinates in ascending order.
7. Iterate through the sorted strip points and compare the distances with the closest pair found so far.
8. Return the closest pair of points.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the closest pair algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of points in the given set. This is because the algorithm involves sorting the points and performing recursive operations.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity of the closest pair algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of points in the given set. This is because the algorithm requires additional space to store the sorted points and the strip of points.
