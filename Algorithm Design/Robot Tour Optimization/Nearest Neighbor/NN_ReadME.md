# Nearest Neighbor Algorithm

The Nearest Neighbor algorithm is a simple and intuitive algorithm used in various fields, including computer science and data analysis. It is primarily used for solving optimization problems, such as the traveling salesman problem.

## How does it work?

1. Start with an initial point or node.
2. Find the nearest unvisited neighbor to the current node.
3. Move to the nearest neighbor and mark it as visited.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all nodes have been visited.
5. Return to the starting point to complete the tour.

## Advantages

- Simple and easy to understand.
- Provides a good approximation for solving optimization problems.
- Works well for small to medium-sized datasets.

## Limitations

- Does not guarantee an optimal solution.
- Can be sensitive to the starting point.
- Inefficient for large datasets.

## Applications

- Traveling salesman problem.
- Vehicle routing problem.
- Image recognition.
- DNA sequencing.

## Implementation

The Nearest Neighbor algorithm can be implemented in various programming languages, such as Python, Java, and C++. It involves calculating the distance between nodes and keeping track of visited nodes.

Here is a simple example in Python:

```python
def nearest_neighbor(graph, start_node):
    visited = set()
    path = [start_node]
    
    while len(visited) < len(graph):
        current_node = path[-1]
        nearest_neighbor = None
        min_distance = float('inf')
        
        for neighbor in graph[current_node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                distance = calculate_distance(current_node, neighbor)
                if distance < min_distance:
                    min_distance = distance
                    nearest_neighbor = neighbor
        
        visited.add(nearest_neighbor)
        path.append(nearest_neighbor)
    
    return path

# Example usage
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C', 'D'],
    'B': ['A', 'C', 'D'],
    'C': ['A', 'B', 'D'],
    'D': ['A', 'B', 'C']
}

start_node = 'A'
result = nearest_neighbor(graph, start_node)
print(result)
```

Remember to replace `calculate_distance` with your own distance calculation function based on your problem domain.
